The following Chef Automate HA architecture diagram shows the Chef Automate HA components that works on the **Leader-Follower** strategy. This architecture includes the cluster of the Chef Automate, Chef Server, Postgres, and Elasticsearch.

**PostgreSQL** stores all application service, secret, recovery, and data. **Elastic Search** stores compliance and client-run data and requires these data to be accessible in real-time. A Load balancer distributes to each of the Chef Automate components.

**Journalbeat** and **Metricbeat** are common for all database instances. **Journalbeat** installed as an agent on the servers collects all the services logs and forwards them to Elasticsearch. **Metricbeat** installed on the servers periodically collects metrics from the operating system and services running on the server and sends them to the **Kibana**.

**Kibana** is an open-source, web-based data visualization and analytical tool that allows you to explore, visualize, and build a dashboard over the log data massed in Elasticsearch clusters. Kibana is a part of the Elastic Stack and integrates with Elasticsearch. The **Kibana Dashboard** is a collection of charts, graphs, metrics, searches, and maps in a single pane and provides at-a-glance insights into data from different perspectives enabling you to drill down into the details.

## Chef Automate Clusters

The Chef Automate HA architecture involves the following clusters part of the main cluster, which are:

- Backend Cluster and Nodes

The backend components connect into the frontend Chef Habitat supervisor cluster. The **postgres** and **elasticsearch** instances run in the Chef Habitat supervisor. The **Postgres** and **Elasticsearch** databases require a minimum of three nodes, where one becomes a leader, and the other two are followers.

- Frontend Cluster and Nodes

Chef Automate and Chef Server act as frontend nodes and serve as a web UI with load balancer configurations.

## Chef Automate Cluster Nodes

The backend and frontend clusters comprise **four** different servers with HA mode, which are as follows:

1. Chef-automate
2. Chef Infra Server
3. Elasticsearch - an open-source search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene, built with Java. It is a time-series and NoSQL database that stores data in an unstructured way and is used for indexing purposes.
4. PostgreSQL - an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

<!-- ! -- These four components reside in a VPC under one network in AWS. Every node sits on a specific machine irrespective of a database. Single database for all three nodes of automate. -->

Elastic Search internally manages the communication and backup and does not follow any leader-follower strategy.

## Deployment Methods

Chef Automate High Availability (HA) supports two types of deployment, which are

### Amazon Web Services (AWS) Deployment

AWS is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage, and content delivery services. Learn more @ <https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/>.

The entire Chef Automate HA infrastructure is built into the AWS cloud in AWS deployment. A standard **Terraform** script handles AWS deployment if you choose AWS as a reference architecture. This deployment terraform script first sets up all the prerequisites like creating an EC2, load balancer, security groups, subnets. Ensure you have given the existing **VPCID** for security purposes, and you have created the **CIDR** block manually based on respective **VPC**.

Its a standard cloud service. Later, a series of configurations and installations follows:

- installing Chef Automate into the Chef Automate instances
- installing Chef Infra Server in all chef-server instances
- installing and configuring **PostgreSQL** into the **postres** instances
- configuring and installing **Elasticsearch** into **elasticsearch** instances, and
- installing a Chef Habitat and creating a supervisor network.

### On-premise Deployment (Existing Node) Deployment

A **Bare Metal computer** is generally without any software (OS or applications). However, when contrasted with a virtualized server environment, bare metal may imply a regular, non-virtual server that does include an OS.

In cloud computing, a bare-metal server is a non-shared computer dedicated to one customer. It generally implies a non-virtual machine (VM) environment. The difference between bare metal servers and cloud servers is that a cloud server is a virtual machine while the bare metal server is a physical machine identified within a data center.

Bare Metal deployments are installations of operating systems to targets that either have no operating system installed or must be re-installed without preserving any existing data or settings. You can install and manage Chef Automate HA by creating profiles for bare metal deployments.

Some customers already have basic network infrastructure with VMs, networks, load balancers in their environment. This environment can be on-premises or in the cloud, and the respective organizations might not want to provide access to create items like VMs. In such cases, IPs of their instances are used to set up Chef Automate HA on their network premises.

As an AWS setup, **Terraform** creates all components from scratch like EC2, Load Balancer. If you don't let **Terraform** create them, or the customer has already made those by themselves, or customers have on-premises servers, or the customers wants to configure Chef Automate HA (**automate**, **chef-server**, **elasticsearch**, **postgresql**) in HA servers, then the customer should choose **Existing Node** reference architecture.

You can also execute the **Terraform** script for the bare infra deployment scenario. However, this script only handles installing and configuring components and does not create instances on the cloud providers.
